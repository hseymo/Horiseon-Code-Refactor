DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT:
This is a project refactoring code. This landing page for Horiseon contains both HTML and CSS components. This page has been refactored to follow accessibility standards and therefore be optimized for assistive technologies and search engines. Upon reviewing the page, you will find:
- HTML uses semantic elements. This helps communicate to video captions, screen readers, braille keyboards and other assistive technologies what the components of the page are. 
- HTML follows logical structure. It is broken down into easy to read parts, like the header, main, aside, articles, footer. 
- The images and logos on the page have alt attributes to explain the image should it not appear or be read by a screen-reader.
- Headings are logical and sequential; making them easy to follow.
- The website's title is descriptive of what the page represents. 
- Please note that the page is a WIP and is not yet optimized for screens smaller tha 768px.
